        <p>I enjoy reading, and drawing as my main two hobbies. recently I've really enjoyed the challange that 
            coding has given me. cooking is another huge hobbie of mine and is the main art form that I use to 
            express myself, it also makes my wife happy which is a huge plus for me.
